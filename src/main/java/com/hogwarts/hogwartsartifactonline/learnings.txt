JSON INFINITE RECURSION
1) For a bidirectional one to many mapping, we might land into Stack overflow error.
For eg:                                           ______ Artifact(id 6)
                                                 |
          Artifact(Id 1)------>Wizard(id 4)--------------Artifact(id 5)
                                                 |
                                                 |________ Artifact(id 1) ----> Wizard(id 4) and so on.....

This can be avoided in multiple ways.
1) Using Json Ignore annotation so that one side is not part of json and will be skipped.
2) Using JSONBackReference(on child entity) and JsonManagedReference(on Parent entity)
3) Using DTO Pattern(which will be using as we don't have to expose entity info on the json)
